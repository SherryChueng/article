    <p>LIKE THE EVENING PRIMROSE, the British television producer Ash Atalla blooms in the dark: sitting at a low table in London’s Groucho Club, the soft light glinting off a bottle of Saint-Émilion; traversing the macadam midnight streets of Islington;
      slipping on an ebony velvet suit jacket en route to a dinner party. He knew his favorite color was gray when he was 5. </p>

  <div class="quote" align="center">
    <h3>“I think brightness is a bit overrated,” he says. “If I could paint the world a nice, dark, comforting gray, I would. I might
      be the perfect Londoner.”</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="p1" align="center">
    <p>This disinterest in sunniness also defines his work. As the most celebrated producer of television comedy in England in the last 15 years, from “The Office” and “The IT Crowd” to <a href="#http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b062r9t5">“People Just Do Nothing,”</a>      the current BBCThree mockumentary about a group of scraggly underground club kids, the 44-year-old Atalla cultivates writers who share his lacerating black humor. Often, it finds its source in his hapless characters’ everyday awkwardness, with which
      Atalla — who considers himself a “low-level, ineffectual troublemaker” — sympathizes.

  <div class="2p" align="center">
    <p>The son of doctors who emigrated from Cairo to Northern Ireland when he was 4, Atalla has lived in London since he was 20. Though he was raised in a warm, knickknack-filled townhouse in Fleet, outside the city, decorated in good English tradition
      — down to the dark-wood tables and overstuffed sofas — the desire to make a permanent home of his own eluded him into adulthood. Even after HBO signed his company, <a href="#http://www.roughcut-tv.com/about/">Roughcut TV</a>, to a deal in 2015,
      he lived quite lean: Unlike his friend Ricky Gervais, who bought himself a massive brick mansion in Hampstead, Atalla’s grandest possessions until recently were an Audi A7 and a rose gold Rolex Daytona. He kept an apartment within the Gothic Revival
      St. Pancras Renaissance Hotel in the once-gritty King’s Cross neighborhood, where the big attraction was the room service, which he learned too late had an 100-pound-an-order minimum. (“A bloody expensive spaghetti Bolognese,” he concedes.)</p>
    <p>Finally, in 2013, as the long-planned King’s Cross development — a mixed-use complex, now home to the fashion college Central Saint Martins and soon to Google U.K. — began to rise on a 67-acre derelict plot in his beloved, bedraggled city center,
      he decided it was time for a space that better expressed his minor-key heart. Despite reveling in the raucous, often messy, atmosphere created by the young staff in his nearby office, Atalla wanted a refuge that was minimalist and fetchingly gloomy.
      He purchased a two-bedroom penthouse at the 15-story Tapestry building, a residential tower in the complex designed by <a href="#http://www.niallmclaughlin.com/">Niall McLaughlin Architects</a>. Finished last year — Atalla moved in March — it has
      a bold, unfussy exterior, with a skin of terracotta-colored concrete.

  <div class="2p" align="center">
    <p>BEHIND THE FLAT’S massive black door now lies a dramatic world created by the polymathic East London-based designer <a href="#http://fayetoogood.com/">Faye Toogood</a>, whose studio Atalla heard about from a design-minded friend, and whose aesthetic
      overlaps with his, uncannily. While he was deeply involved in the process (“I’m not someone who likes to give up control,” he says), he appreciated that the design team understood his desire to have “almost nothing around,” while creating cerebral,
      challenging rooms that were effortlessly functional. The only thing in the windowless 170-square-foot entry, for instance, is a 16-foot totem that Toogood fashioned from stacked plaster rectangles in chalky shades of gunmetal, charcoal and ivory.
      It seems to pierce the skylight, like a missile on a launchpad.</p>
    <p>“The idea with the sculpture is that guests would immediately know they were no longer in a regular, predictable environment,” says Toogood, who began her career as decoration editor for The World of Interiors magazine, and, since striking out on
      her own a decade ago, now designs furniture (such as her signature resin Roly-Poly chair, which resembles the bottom half of a cartoon elephant), art and even unisex, smocklike garments. While some British designers fight against the country’s climate
      by whitewashing walls and installing abundant lighting, Toogood, like Atalla, embraces its dreariness. “Painting things white means you lose a lot of the nuance that comes with the subtle light that passes through a space over the course of a day,”
      she says. “It flattens things and makes them boring.”</p>

    <p>While she’s known for her ability to harmonize the embellishments of classic British architecture with her dusky, organic modernism (in a recent project’s bathroom, she hung Baroque gilt mirrors over an industrial trough sink), in this case, the building
      was brand new, unmoored from cultural touchstones: There were no Regency-era moldings to accommodate; no marble mantels to respect. Indeed, the only nod to Englishness are the floors — herringbone parquet. They contrast harmoniously with the walls,
      which are plaster, painted a greenish-gray hue Toogood calls Sludge, then waxed and polished to create a textured swirl that’s velvety to the touch. The furnishings are spare and the surfaces are nearly clear of decorative objets; the lines geometric
      and uncompromising. “I hate quirk in home décor,” Atalla says. “The idea of funny shapes just for the sake of it strikes me as embarrassing.”</p>
    <p>The overall effect is monumental and a bit formal, but leavened by clear, pale sunlight that, on good days at least, streams through the 12-foot windows and the three skylights. The public areas are divided by an atrium with a retractable glass ceiling;
      Toogood turned the area beneath into a contemplative place for morning coffee by staggering five floating plaster shelves on the wall, each topped with a bonsai, with hopes that Atalla would tend to them for years to come. In the evening, as the
      lights of Regent’s Canal flicker below, and the sprawling city is laid out in endless vistas, Atalla says the spare space is “so glamorous you just don’t want to move.”</p>

  </div>
  <div class="h2" align="center">
    <p>Another reason the apartment feels welcoming despite its austerity is that everything is a bit closer to the ground than usual; Atalla, who had polio as a baby, uses a wheelchair. By playing with scale — emphasizing the horizontal over the vertical,
      and slightly changing the proportions of some furniture, including the sofa and bed — Toogood didn’t have to sacrifice streamlined beauty for accessibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      The design team did face one challenge, though: getting Atalla to feel comfortable with art. In the past, he shied from it. “I never wanted to be one of those pretentious people who get rich and suddenly they’re spending all their money in galleries,
      pretending they have taste,” he says. Still, Toogood’s staff convinced him to let her craft a few pieces. Above his concrete desk is a blown-up black-and-white photo of Slough, the industrial suburb where “The Office” was set; on a floating shelf
      nearby is a set of small abstract matte plaster sculptures inspired by the shapes of his many awards, none of which are on display. “I feel as though we did what we set out to do, which was to make somewhere really cool but not obnoxious,” Atalla
      says. “You don’t want to become a caricature — for me, that would be death.”</p>
